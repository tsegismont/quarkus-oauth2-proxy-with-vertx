<p>Hello, {userInfo.login}!</p>
<p>
    {#if userInfo.email} It looks like your public email address is {userInfo.email}.
    {#else} It looks like you don't have a public email. That's cool.
    {/if}

<p>
    {#if userInfo.privateEmails}
    With your permission, we were also able to dig up your private email addresses:
        {userInfo.privateEmailsAsString}
    {#else}
    Also, you're a bit secretive about your private email addresses.
    {/if}
