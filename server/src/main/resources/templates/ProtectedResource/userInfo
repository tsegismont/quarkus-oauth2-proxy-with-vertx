<h1>Your profile information</h1>
<p>Well, well, well, <strong>{userInfo.login}</strong>!</p>
<p>
    {#if userInfo.email} It looks like your public email address is <strong>{userInfo.email}</strong>.
    {#else} It looks like you don't have a public email. That's cool.
    {/if}
</p>
<p>
    {#if userInfo.privateEmails}
    With your permission, we were also able to dig up your private email addresses:
<ul>
    {#each value in userInfo.privateEmails}
        <li><strong>{value}</strong></li>
    {/each}
</ul>
{#else}
    Also, you're a bit secretive about your private email addresses.
